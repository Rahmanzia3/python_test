Based on decades of AI research, years of experience working with organizations of all sizes, and on learnings from over 30,000 IBM Watson engagements, IBM has developed the AI Ladder for successful artificial intelligence deployments.
</p>
<p>
	Collect: Simplifying data collection and accessibility.
</p>
<p>
	Analyze: Building scalable and trustworthy AI-driven systems.
</p>
<p>
	Infuse: Integrating and optimizing systems across an entire business framework.
</p>
<p>
	Modernize: Bringing your AI applications and systems to the cloud.
</p>

#### Auto AI

<p>Using AutoAI, you can build and deploy a machine learning model with sophisticated training features and no coding. The tool does most of the work for you. Generally Text data is deployed in Auto AI.
</p>
<p>
	Data pre-processing:  AutoAI applies various algorithms, or estimators,to analyze, clean, and prepare your raw data for machine learning.
</p>
<p>
	Automated model selection:It selects model which best fit for your data.This approach saves time without sacrificing performance.
</p>
<p>
	Automated feature engineering:Feature engineering attempts to transform the raw data into the combination of features that best represents the problem to achieve the most accurate prediction.
</p>
<p>
	Hyperparameter optimization:AutoAI uses a novel hyper-parameter optimization algorithm optimized for costly function evaluations such as model training and scoring that are typical in Machines learning.
</p>

#### Apache Spark

<p>
	Apche spark was basically developed for big data analysis. IBM uses it for AI like training on multiple cloud/ physical system. It is generally deployed when you have datasets in multiple millions.
</p>

#### Watson Assistant

<p>
	Watson Assistant is a conversation AI platform that helps you provide customers fast, straightforward and accurate answers to their questions, across any application, device or channel. By addressing common customer inquiries, Watson Assistant reduces the cost of customer interactions, helping your agents focus on complex use cases â€“ not repetitive responses.
</p>

#### Annotator for Clinical Data

<p>
	This is use to extract specific characters from input data (generally TEXT /NLP).
</p>


#### Language Translator

<p>
	IBM Watson Language Translator can identify the language of text and translate it into different languages programmatically.In addition to using the provided translation models, you can build upon the base translation models to create your own custom models for your use case.
</p>


#### Watson Machine Learning

<p>
	Using IBM Watson Machine Learning, you can build analytical models and neural networks, trained with your own data, that you can deploy for use in applications.Watson Machine Learning provides a full range of tools and services so you can build, train, and deploy Machine Learning models. Choose from tools that fully automate the training process for rapid prototyping to tools that give you complete control to create a model that matches your needs.
</p>

#### Natural Language Classifier

<p>
	IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier uses machine learning algorithms to return the top matching predefined classes for short text inputs.Natural Language Classifier can help your application understand the language of short texts and make predictions about how to handle them. A classifier learns from your example data and then can return information for texts that it is not trained on.
</p>

#### Natural Language Understanding

<p>
	Use advanced NLP to analyze text and extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion, relations, and semantic roles. Apply custom annotation models developed using Watson Knowledge Studio to identify industry/domain specific entities and relations in unstructured text with Watson NLU.
</p>

#### Speech to Text

<p>
	The Speech to Text service converts the human voice into the written word. It can be used anywhere there is a need to bridge the gap between the spoken word and their written form, including voice control of embedded systems, transcription of meetings and conference calls, and dictation of email and notes. This easy-to-use service uses machine intelligence to combine information about grammar and language structure with knowledge of the composition of the audio signal to generate an accurate transcription. The following languages and features are currently available:
</p>
<p>
	English (US), English (UK), Japanese, Arabic (MSA, Broadband model only), Mandarin, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, French (Broadband model only), Korean
</p>

#### Text to Speech

<p>
	The Text to Speech service processes text and natural language to generate synthesized audio output complete with appropriate cadence and intonation. It is available in several voices:
	English (US), English (UK), French, German, Italian, Spanish (Castilian), Spanish (North American), Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Mobile SDKs (BETA), TTS customization API (BETA)
</p>

#### Tone Analyzer

<p>
	People show various tones, such as joy, sadness, anger, and agreeableness, in daily communications. Such tones can impact the effectiveness of communication in different contexts. Tone Analyzer leverages cognitive linguistic analysis to identify a variety of tones at both the sentence and document level. This insight can then used to refine and improve communications. It detects three types of tones, including emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy and sadness)
</p>

#### Visual Recognition

<p>
	Find meaning in visual content! Analyze images for scenes, objects, and other content. Choose a default model off the shelf, or create your own custom classifier. Develop smart applications that analyze the visual content of images or video frames to understand what is happening in a scene.
</p>

#### Voice Agent with Watson

<p>
	Voice Agent with Watson enhances your call center operations by orchestrating Watson services and integrating them with the telephone network. Your voice agent can listen and respond to customers using natural language.
